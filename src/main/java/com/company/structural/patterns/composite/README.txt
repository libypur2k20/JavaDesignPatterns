STRUCTURAL PATTERNS - COMPOSITE


What is composite?
------------------

- We have a part-whole relationship or hierarchy of objects, and we want to be able to
  treat all objects in this hierarchy uniformly.

- This is NOT a simple composition concept from object-oriented programming, but a
  further enhancement to that principal.

- Think of composite pattern when dealing with tree structure of objects.


Implement a Composite
---------------------

- We start by creating an abstract class / interface for Component.
    * Component must declare all methods that are applicable to both leaf and composite.
    * We have to choose who defines the children management operations, component or composite.
    * Then we implement the composite. An operation invoked on composite is propagated to all
      its children.
    * In leaf nodes, we have to handle the non-applicable operations like add/remove a child if
     they are defined in component.

- In the end, a composite pattern implementation will allow you to write algorithms without
  worrying about whether node is leaf or composite.
