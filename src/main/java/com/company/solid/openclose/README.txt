OPEN-CLOSE PRINCIPLE
Software entities (Classes, Modules, Methods, etc.) should be open
for extension, but closed for modification.

- Open for extension: Extend existing behavior.
  Derived class - Can derive from base and override methods.

- Closed for modification: Existing code remains unchanged.
  Base class - Avoid modifying base class.
